## Kirosh-phase-1 (for Hackathon)
<br>
  We aimed to support a young entrepreneur named Tesfaye. He is an inspiration with exceptional crochet abilities, specializing in creating multiple patterned baby booties. We discovered his work on social media and noticed that he was having trouble finding customers. Without a proper platform to promote and sell his creations, he resorted to selling them on the street near Bole airport. Our web application aims to resolve this issue by providing him with a space to display his work and accept orders directly from interested buyers.
